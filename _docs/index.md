# Shout

Welcome to the documentation. __It's currently a work in progress.__

## Help needed

I want your help!

This documentation is being hosted on GitHub via gh-pages and uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
It's simply a collection of Markdown files.

You can edit the content directly from the GitHub file editor.

It would be really awesome if people could help me make this documentation the best!

Thank you.
