It's been about two weeks since Shout went viral &mdash; reaching 2000 stars on [GitHub](http://github.com/erming/shout) yesterday. And today I'm introducing the __Shout Developer Blog__!

I'm going to keep this blog updated with weekly updates, new features and announcements. In the coming month, my goal is to release a stable `1.0.0` release.

## Status report:

Over the last two weeks, this has happened:

- 2000 stars on [GitHub](http://github.com/erming/shout)
- 110 issues opened, [80 closed](https://github.com/erming/shout/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
- This website launched
- Started writing the [documentation](/docs/)
- 14000 downloads via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/shout)
