# Shout

Welcome to the documentation. __It's currently a work in progress.__

Here's the repository: [erming/shout-website](http://github.com/erming/shout-website)

## Help out

I want your help!

The documentation is hosted on GitHub via gh-pages and uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
The documentation is simply a collection Markdown files.

It would be really awesome if people could help me make this documentation the best!

You can edit the documentation directly from the GitHub file editor.
